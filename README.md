# PocketBase Manager (`pb-manager`)

`pb-manager` is a comprehensive command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to streamline the deployment and management of multiple PocketBase instances on a single Linux server. It handles everything from installation and process management (PM2) to reverse proxy configuration (Nginx) and SSL automation (Certbot).

It supports **Debian-based** (Ubuntu, Debian), **RHEL-based** (Fedora, CentOS, Oracle Linux), and **Arch-based** Linux distributions.

**Version: 0.9.0**

## Key Features

- **Automated Instance Setup:** Downloads PocketBase, initializes data directories, and sets up system services in minutes.
- **Nginx Reverse Proxy Automation:**
  - Automatically generates Nginx virtual blocks with security headers.
  - Supports **HTTP/2**.
  - **Realtime Optimization:** Optional configuration to tune `/api/realtime` for Server-Sent Events (SSE), ensuring stable, long-lived connections.
  - Customizable `client_max_body_size` for large file uploads.
- **Security & Access Control:**
  - **IP Restrictions:** Limit access to your entire instance or just the Admin UI (`/_/`) to specific IP addresses.
  - **SSL/TLS:** Automates Let's Encrypt certificate acquisition and renewal via Certbot.
- **Process Management:** Built on top of **PM2** to ensure your instances are always running and restart automatically on boot or failure.
- **Maintenance Tools:**
  - `update-pocketbase`: Updates the PocketBase binary and restarts all instances.
  - `reset` / `remove`: Tools to wipe data or decommission instances cleanly.
  - `reset-admin`: Quickly reset the admin password for any instance.
- **Self-Updating:** The tool can update itself to the latest version from GitHub.

## Prerequisites

The installer handles most dependencies, but ensure you have:
- A supported Linux OS (Debian, Ubuntu, CentOS, Fedora, Arch, etc.)
- `root` or `sudo` access.
- Basic tools: `curl`, `git`.
- **Node.js v20.x+** (The installer will attempt to install this if missing).

## Installation

### Automated Install (Recommended)

Run the following command to download and run the installer script. This will set up Node.js, PM2, Nginx, Certbot, and `pb-manager` itself.

```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devAlphaSystem/Alpha-System-PBManager/main/install-pb-manager.sh -o /tmp/install-pb-manager.sh && sudo bash /tmp/install-pb-manager.sh && sudo rm /tmp/install-pb-manager.sh
```

### Manual Installation

1.  **Install Dependencies:** Node.js 20+, PM2, Nginx, Certbot.
2.  **Download Script:**
    ```bash
    sudo mkdir -p /opt/pb-manager
    sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devAlphaSystem/Alpha-System-PBManager/main/pb-manager.js -o /opt/pb-manager/pb-manager.js
    sudo chmod +x /opt/pb-manager/pb-manager.js
    ```
3.  **Install NPM Packages:**
    ```bash
    cd /opt/pb-manager
    sudo npm init -y
    sudo npm install commander inquirer@8.2.4 fs-extra axios chalk@4.1.2 unzipper shelljs
    ```
4.  **Create Symlink:**
    ```bash
    sudo ln -sfn /opt/pb-manager/pb-manager.js /usr/local/bin/pb-manager
    ```

## Usage

Run `pb-manager` with `sudo` to perform tasks.

```bash
sudo pb-manager <command> [options]
```
